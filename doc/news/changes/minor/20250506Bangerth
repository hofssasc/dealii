Changed: When the SUNDIALS::KINSOL solver fails to converge, it
returns an error. In the past, deal.II then aborted the program (in
debug mode), but there are cases where KINSOL's failure can make
legitimate sense, and where a user program could catch the error and
re-start, perhaps from a better chosen starting point. As a
consequence, the behavior has been changed: Instead of aborting the
program, SUNDIALS::KINSOL now throws an exception (in both debug and
release mode) that can be caught and processed by user code.
