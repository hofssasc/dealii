Fixed: FETools::extrapolate previously failed to correctly compress ghost values on
MPI simulations with distributed triangulation and LinearAlgebra::distributed
vectors, due to the different behaviours of the compress(insert) operation on
Petsc/Trilinos and LinearAlgebra::distributed vectors. This is now fixed.
